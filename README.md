Matrix Operations Calculator

This is a Python-based matrix calculator that performs various arithmetic operations on matrices using the NumPy library. It supports basic arithmetic between matrices, dot product multiplication, and single-matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and more advanced operations like finding the inverse and transpose.

Features

The program offers three main types of matrix operations:

	1.	Arithmetic Operations for Two Matrices:
	•	Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication (element-wise), and Division.
	•	Both matrices must have the same shape.
	2.	Dot Matrix Multiplication:
	•	Dot product multiplication between two matrices.
	•	Requires that the number of columns in Matrix A is equal to the number of rows in Matrix B.
	3.	Arithmetic Operations for a Single Matrix:
	•	Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with a scalar.
	•	Advanced operations include:
	•	Square Root
	•	Power of each element
	•	Sum of all elements (with options for row-wise and column-wise sums)
	•	Maximum and Minimum elements
	•	Transpose
	•	Inverse (only for square matrices)
